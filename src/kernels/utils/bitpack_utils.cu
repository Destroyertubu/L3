#include "bitpack_utils.cuh"

// This file contains implementations for bitpacking utilities
// Most functions are defined inline in the header for performance,
// but we keep this file for potential future non-inline functions
// and to maintain clean project structure.

// Placeholder for any future host-side bitpacking utilities
// that don't need to be inlined.

// Currently all critical functions are __device__ inline in the header
// for maximum performance.
